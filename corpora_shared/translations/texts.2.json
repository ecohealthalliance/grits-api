Mumps, more popularly known by the name of 'mumps', is a contagious disease that can be acute or chronic, localized primarily on one or both parotid glands, which are salivary glands located behind the ascending branches of the mandible. It is caused by a virus of the Paramyxoviridae, classically causing disease of children and adolescents, but it can also cause infections in susceptible adults. Usually, the disease produces lifelong immunity. The disease is transmitted by contact with saliva droplets in the air from an infected individual and to a lesser extent, the infection can spread through the urine."},{"id":"532cbe98f99fe75cf5388d30","translation":"Cholera - the democratic Republic of Congo (25)\n\n***********************************************\n\n\n\nArtwork communication of ProMED-mail\n\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\n\nProMED-mail est un encode two\n\nSociété Internationale pour les disease Infectieuses\n\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n\n\nDate: mer. 18 juil. 2012\n\nSource: Radio Okapi [Edit]\n\nhttp://radiookapi.net/actualite/2012/07/18/rdc-plus-de-19-000-cas-de-cholera-enregistres-en-2012-selon-ocha/\n\n\n\n\n\nRDC: 19 000 attractiveness of any case of cholera Registered in 2012, according to OCHA\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nLe Bureau de les affaires to UN humanitaires\n\n(OCHA) s'est dit de l'preoccupied protrusion effrénée\n\nde l'epidemic of cholera hairstyle, based both encrypted\n\ndu Ministère de la Santé et de l'WHO, previously\n\nattractiveness of 19 000 registered any case depuis le Start of\n\n-this round, steel RDC.\n\nLe uploaded agence de communication de-this firmware\n\nSystème Nations unies, Yvon Edounou, the\n\nPrint sounds inquiétude Wednesday 18 août à\n\nKinshasa au intraday two weekly conferencing\n\ntwo UN.\n\nIl assumes the indiqué les encrypted Advanced\n\n90 cent to represent any case des Registered online\n\n2011 et les provinces de la RDC attractiveness affected stakeholders\n\nof cholera are: he Ecuador, le Bas-Congo, le\n\nSud-Kivu and Orientale Province's.\n\nYvon Edounou craint également surprisingly strewn encrypted\n\nsoient revus à la suite upside notably responsive\n\ncomplications order épidémiologique et d'\n\nensuing financial s'annoncent.\n\n\"D'ici tweaks these finals weeks, both financings hairstyle\n\navaient been granted by the Nations unies ranged\n\narrived à Terme.

Clyde Moreira also talks about swine flu and its possible return to Alagoas, which already occurs in the southeastern states.\n\n\n\nDengue fever is under control, in Maceió and within, there is risk of outbreak?\n\n Since the beginning of the year, we showed that municipalities epidemic situation. Epidemic situation we have today in 50 cities in 28 alert and 24 under control, this framework is January so far examined by the secretariat. It is the general framework of the state. We've been dealing with this growth in a joint action between the State and County to combat the mosquito, the service organization both primary care, average pre-hospital and hospital with 24 hours services at referral hospitals - HDT, HU and HGE - in situations of severe cases. The state is monitored daily, weekly and track who has entered into an epidemic to maintain disease control.\n\n\n\nIn the capital, where most areas infested with Aedes aegypti, the transmitter of dengue?\n\n Maceio have 30 districts in epidemic situation, alert and 17 in three under control. Among the most infected districts are Pajuçara with 1,708 cases, with 1,262 Mangabeiras and Lighthouse neighborhood with 1,090 registered cases each per 100 thousand inhabitants.\n\n\n\nAnd inside, which municipalities most problematic?\n\n Bethlehem with 3,340 cases per 100 000 inhabitants, with 1,344 Cacimbinhas, Two Creeks 1,204 cases, with 1,618 Murici, Palmeira dos Indios in 1350, Palestine with 1,115, 1,357 and Rio Largo Boulder with 1,100. All of these are rate above a thousand and are therefore the most common.\n\n\n\nThe fight against mosquitoes here in Maceió, is permanent or only when it increases the incidence of dengue cases in hospitals?\n\n We are fighting the vector that transmits the disease every day of the year, from first to last week of every month. It's a constant, systematic work by the health officer, who is fighting vector in the home, which is where the largest number of outbreaks, 90% of cases. Today, we have almost two thousand agents endemic in every state, each viewing on average 25 homes, identifying and destroying foci. There is not a day that we stop. In epidemic situations we work harder, decreasing the time to visit the homes of 60 to 15 days, making a rework that municipality to stop the epidemic that is ongoing. For those on epidemic situation with disease transmission we also works assistance with areas that are responsible, primary care, medium and high complexity where it is necessary to have an adequate structure to receive and adopt the patient all treatment that is done in Regarding patients.\n\n\n\nHow many types of dengue are there? The bleeding is the most serious?\n\n Are two types: classical, where the person gets sick, the whole picture has progressed well and often it comes in the same house. The other type is dengue hemorrhagic fever that is when you present the warning signs, ie, spontaneous and / or provoked bleeding that may be bleeding from the gums, nose, increased bleeding, gastrointestinal bleeding and other effusions that the patient can have. This is already a severe dengue. The onset of his illness is dengue fever, when you go to the classic hemorrhagic because something failed: either you have not been duly served, or you stayed home and only came to us late or you searched several places and not her responded according to what is recommended and then you develop the severe form and if not adequately meet death may occur. There's just like having DHF.\n\n\n\nWhat are the main symptoms of the disease?\n\n Headache, pain in joints and muscles, but may also have pain in the cavity of the eye occurs, in addition to fever. The fever is high, it reaches 39, 40 degrees. At this present moment we are recording with lower dengue fever, and we do not know what changed this pattern; but we have had cases of people with dengue fever with very low that is not even 38 degrees. Dengue fever is an acute febrile illness, this is the definition of the disease.\n\n\n\nWho show signs of dengue should immediately seek a clinic or hospital?\n\n Find services in the first 24 hours. It is the obligation of the patient does not stay at home for three or four days, because then when he looks in the fourth or fifth day, you can already come up with several symptoms that may be warning signs for DHF. So, the warning signs, which are abdominal pain, spontaneous bleeding and provoked, less than 100 thousand, plate should already find a hospital, in the case of dengue hemorrhagic fever and then this patient can not be treated in a basic unit. But when is the start of the illness with fever, headache, body pain in the first 24 hours he should seek a basic unit, it can be serviced there and after the exams is what will be possible to see which stage of the disease to be given the appropriate treatment.\n\n\n\nThere should be punishment (fine or up to the sentencing practice of community service) who impedes access to health workers in infested residences vectors?\n\n The national dengue control program already has a legal provision establishing procedures to intervene in households who refuse to give access to the agent. To operate in a closed house, abandoned, there is a whole procedure to be followed so that the agent can enter and make the visit vector control and not easy to get. If you've been in a house where the owner said he did not want to work at his house, there are people who accompany the agent to convince the homeowner to do the job. This is what we call home pending, which can be closed or denied. If she is refused is easier if it is closed it is necessary to find a way to open it and only by legal means, which is very time consuming. In Brazil there is no penalty, no penalty for these owners residence. In my opinion as a technique, but there should be punishment because there is pending in Maceio to reach 30%, as is the case of Ponta Verde, where people do not want to open your door to the agent.\n\n\n\nIn short, what people should do to prevent the spread of dengue?\n\n What the people have to do as well as the rulers, mayors and secretaries, each one is taking care of it is your responsibility. The public areas, talking about municipal manager, must be kept clean, as wastelands with no vegetation, gathering garbage from the streets, the cleaning of the streets, keeping the city clean, what is the duty of any manager. This is healthy not only in relation to dengue, but also for several other diseases. Managers also have to monitor and supervise the construction, the junkyards and tire stores that are great creators of mosquitoes. But when we speak of the population, is not to let accumulated water at home in pail, cask, water tank, bottle, pot or other container in which there is water storage. You need capping, stay protected. Put a plastic, cloth, a dish, but do not let these containers discovered and then I'm being jealous not allowing the mosquito in there to make your play. Clear your yard, collect your trash and place it properly. That's what it is for the population, keep these care because dengue is now a matter of everyone.\n\n\n\n Influenza A is resurfacing in the southeastern states. This framework concerns Alagoas?\n\n Concerned, but on the level of the states of South and Southeast. Alagoas, in 2009, when the introduction of H1N1no country was part of the pandemic. We are reorganizing ourselves, but we never fail to monitor: in 2009, the year of the pandemic had 118 confirmed cases with 32; in 2010 were 92 confirmed cases with 26; in 2011 we had 11 reported cases and discarded all, none confirmed. And now in 2012 we have so far 10 suspected influenza cases and has no confirmed. Of these, four were discarded, two deaths dropped by H1N1, or was for other illness, one death under investigation pending results and three cases under investigation. Since last year we had a major initiative was the vaccination that protected against the three flu viruses: influenza B (flu), H1N1 (swine flu) and H3N2 reaching important and vulnerable groups, the elderly, pregnant women, prison population, indigenous population of less than six months to two years and health workers. Because of this advancement of disease in other states, we are already thinking about strategies besides vaccine to contain the spread of the disease in Alagoas. It is necessary that the population will continue to maintain hygiene care such as washing hands, use alcohol gel, scarf, exhale protecting the virus to avoid playing in other people. These are educational measures that people should follow, always, regardless of H1N1.\n\n"},{"id":"532ccaf9f99fe75cf538abfb","translation":"\nYesterday, many of the citizens of Nanjing received a mobile phone text message, the content is to alert the public to prevent infectious diseases, inscribed as \"the provincial health department.\" Modern Express reporter interviewed the Health Department of Jiangsu Province, the provincial health department said that the province is currently stable epidemic, but because of factors such as typhoon, their first attempt in this way, to promote and to draw public attention to the prevention of disease.

With a uniform label, consumers can recognize where it came from food products, and more \"aware\" buy regional products.\n\n\n\nAgricultural Minister Ilse Aigner and consumer protection.\n\n\nHowever, with so many consumers in Germany have to change their consumption patterns. In German supermarkets are now almost all year round food products from around the world. Now many consumers no longer know what fruits or vegetables are in season now in Germany.\n\nBack to the original case, gastric and stomach infection outbreak among German students because of school cafeteria food contaminated Norovirus, Martin Rucker from Foodwatch organization requires serious action. \"We're always talking, about the education of children about respect for food. This is the time\", he said. Rucker was also criticized for cafeteria food ordering students, which mainly emphasizes on price, rather than quality of food.\n\nFood imports cheaper\n\nAlso about the price plays a major role, in the case of strawberries imported from China were contaminated with Norovirus is now proven. China is now a net importer of frozen strawberries to Germany's second-largest, because the product of the country's very cheap.\n\nNow the food and health problems, turned into a political issue. \"Is that cheap imported foodstuffs must be purchased or, depending on the decisions and political vision\" added Martin Rucker. \"It's a discussion that we have to undertake community. Whether in schools or public institutions, such cheap products will still be purchased, which means it supports the work requirements that pay very low wages in the country of origin. Alternatively there are other demands?\"\n\n"},{"id":"532cad5bf99fe75cf53861bd","translation":"SANTO DOMINGO.

There are five strains of the virus, an agent highly contagious and often fatal that is spread through direct contact with body fluids.\nIn addition, it is extremely difficult to travel between Isiri and Kiballe, the Ugandan district where the outbreak emerged last month, Hartl said.\nThat is because it is a wooded lot with impassable roads and the only way to travel is through a motorcycle at about 10 or 15 miles per hour. So it is unlikely that there has been contact between Ugandan and Congolese to carry infection.\nThe natural habitat of Ebola virus is the forest belt of central Africa, Hartl said.\nHealth authorities have launched an aggressive approach in Uganda to deal with cases.\nWHO urged countries that border the country \"to strengthen surveillance\" of the virus.

All doctors can do is give supportive treatment based fluids and electrolytes, maintaining blood pressure and other bodily indicators, according to the Center for Disease Control in the United States.\nAnalysts say it is unlikely that the virus will spread to America.\nThe only case of transmission from infected monkeys occurred when research came to the United States, but no human being was infected.\nWHO considers an outbreak ended after 42 days, corresponding to two virus incubation periods of 21 days each time.\n\n"},{"id":"5330341ef99fe75cf538fe60","translation":"\nFlu epidemic expected \"average intensity\"\n\nIncrease in the incidence of influenza is expected in late January - early February, the deputy chief of the Department of Hygiene, Epidemiology and Prevention of the Ministry of Health of Belarus Inna Karaban at a press conference in Minsk on October 9.

Deliberate concealment of this century epidemic caused by the \"blood curse\", the consequences well beyond most people's imagination, reaching appalling, intolerable degree. Similarly outrageous is that the authorities use their power to block the message that the truth, especially leading to at least 30 million people infected with HIV, and at least 10 million people in dire straits Mingfuhuangquan in this disregard for human life \"with blood rich\" campaign, So far as most people are not known. As for the case and why the people behind the scenes manipulation that can not be dealt with so far, even the little known. That's what happened in contemporary China by the maximum number of injuries, to conceal the truth longest time, causing the worst consequences together inhumane \"Henan AIDS door.\"\nHow can we allow this terrible major culprit be punished for such a scheming relevant officials in an attempt to evade accountability for major cases, I have six times respectively, the text entitled \"The causes AIDS outbreak in the Central Plains blood curse responsibility who to blame \",\" Henan foul Case \"ten crimes\" must be liquidated \"and\" the gates of hell Henan Language \"plasma economy\" victims still struggling with despair \"and other materials, real name to CPC General Secretary Hu Jintao and Premier Premier Wen Jiabao report. Because the authorities fear the power of the characters behind the scenes, so I reported on Li and Li Keqiang's repeated refusal, and thus was summoned by the police. Even more outrageous is that despite the countless victims in Henan, the dark and painful era of brutal death, in front of the facts written in blood, actually no one is responsible for this \"blood.\" Devoid of humanity and conscience officials so unfeeling fully exposed the seemingly honorable man, but in reality is a fair without the man's true colors. Many facts show that this public health catastrophe is not \"acts of God\", but completely avoidable man-made disaster. After the disaster, the moral turpitude of officials obviously know how to hide the consequences of the epidemic will cause, but in order to escape punishment, actually do anything, to conceal the truth of the incident as the first choice, Zhennai \"generals do not be timid,\" the leader of a nation man's face lost cleaners. I originally expected to occur during the 15th Chinese Communist Party and this major cases can be resolved within the term of this government during the Communist Party Congress, now seems to have no hope. In such a situation, in order to maintain fairness and justice Henan victims, conscience and health workers for vocation, I had sent an open letter to the forthcoming Bureau of the Eighteenth Party Congress of the CPC and all, appealed to the participants highly concerned about the seriousness of the case, Henan foul, looking with lofty ideals to uphold justice, fairness and justice issued a call for the strongest voice. Thousands of Nono, as a scholar of the Ngok Ngok. The participants look forward to the high sense of responsibility, to break the resistance, the case shall be held primarily responsible Henan foul and cause delays in the investigation of the case behind the controller's responsibility until the criminal liability, urged the General Assembly to such a significant drag on for many years. event to make a political conclusion, a file, two of accountability, the three granting awards to victims, so that the demands of the innocent victims of HIV infection has been done, so unjustly blood curse solace and rest the souls of the nether world. Culprit culprit Li LIU Quan-xi and the large number of farmers into the grave phenomenon is called \"plasma economy\" of the late 1980s to the early 1990s, has appeared in a few areas in Henan Province. Later, \"AIDS director,\" said LIU Quan-xi 1992 as vigorously promote the provincial health director after selling blood to make Henan farmers become trend. Especially since the 1992-1998 Henan officials ruled a serious dereliction of duty and abetting Li Changchun, Henan sell blood to become poor, especially a farmer's \"industry\" has been great development in Henan, a large area of ​​the spread of HIV. After an incubation period of 5-8 years, that Li Keqiang 1998-2004 period, following ruled Henan Li Changchun, a large number of HIV-infected people have the disease and died. Since Li Keqiang, \"Wu Gaizi\" strongly masking evil deeds predecessor, coercion and insisted on whistleblowers and petitioners to combat, so that not only curb the epidemic worsened. If AIDS director LIU Quan-xi is the culprit, Li Changchun is the cause of this catastrophe culprit century, Li Changchun, Li Keqiang, is an accomplice. Prevalence and negative impact on the spread of AIDS in Henan society is enormous. It is not only the destruction of the individual patient, but bring disaster to many families, the death of a large number of the young labor force led to some villages and even more into a piece of villages depressed, it is national disaster. There are 3,500 people in Henan Zhecheng double damiaocun, 1200 people were involved in the wave of selling blood. More than 700 villagers found infected with the AIDS virus, a few years ago, nearly 200 infected people died, some farmers adults die at home. After nearly 4,000 people in Shangcai Yangcun, in 1995 nearly 90% of the adult villagers involved in the wave of selling blood, nearly 700 people infected with HIV, there are at least 250 years ago, the villagers died of AIDS, the disease both parents village lost both parents dead, \"AIDS orphans\" of 26, nearly 300 parents of children who died of AIDS in one. Shangcai Wen village more than 3,100 villagers in AIDS patients up to 900 people, in 2003 the village seven people died in one day. The County Village peak incidence in those years, every year dozens of young people unfortunately died young, an increase in the village graves every day, and some family graves together into one piece. HIV in those years like a ghost wandering in the Central Plains hinterland, making tens of thousands of families loss of life, happiness shattered. The village became a high incidence of AIDS in the country and the desperate cry of the village. Deliberate concealment of the truth led to the outbreak of AIDS in Henan, Henan pandemic conceal the most serious consequences of a major epidemic is out of control and delay the timing of the epidemic prevention and control, and ultimately led to the world's rare in the history of public health tragedy. The outbreak of AIDS in Henan be publicized to the public for the first time. Because of Henan Province, Li Changchun and Li Keqiang two governments regard the epidemic as \"confidential\" and \"restricted\", the international community until 2001 after six years, learned where the AIDS pandemic. In the end how many people are infected with the AIDS virus? September 2004, the Henan AIDS blood selling large numbers of the population can no longer hide, the provincial health department was forced to sell blood by the province conducted a so-called \"comprehensive census.\" That survey confirmed HIV infection in Henan province's only 3 million people, is less than insiders grasp Henan hundreds of thousands of infected persons by a fraction of that figure. On the key issue of concealing the epidemic, the Ministry of Health because impressed by two senior officials, has not opened the masking layer veil that the epidemic in Henan, Henan favoritism and help tell lies. August 2001, which is found in Henan AIDS outbreak six years later, Vice Minister of Health Yin Dakui abroad when answering a reporter's question at a news conference on the State Department said that in some provinces in central China, some underground around 1995 blood collection agencies for commercial interests, with outdated technology means illegal blood plasma collection, resulting in about 30,000 to 50,000 blood donors infected with HIV, which is more than in Henan. Henan in the end how many infected people, he tight-lipped. December 2002, the Minister of Health Zhang Wenkang said at the National People's Congress, China after 1995 years of AIDS because they do not regulate the activities and illegal blood collection caused the spread, involving 23 provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities. Focus on rural areas for staff infection plasma is generally 10% -20%, up to 60%, in the end how many people Henan infected with HIV, he and Yin Dakui not reported as hidden. January 2005 Health Minister Gao Qiang told a news conference on the State Department, the country through blood collection channels, including hemophilia blood personnel and personnel, a total of 70,000 people infected with HIV, said nothing about how the epidemic in Henan. Visible to conceal the epidemic in Henan Province, Henan Province, is not only wrong, but the Chinese government. Coincidentally possessed Ironically, when the succession of high-strength due to conceal SARS (ie SARS) outbreak and the big sacked Zhang Wenkang year later, faced with the problem of Henan AIDS pandemic and to repeat the mistakes of the former to conceal the epidemic can be described as long-standing Except difficult. Zhoukou Area Health Dr Wang Shuping quarantine center in Henan Province in 1995 found HIV prevalence report, caused a shock in China rise. Premier Li Peng when he was Minister of Health Chen Zeng Chapter thorough investigation, Chen had sent Vice Minister of Health Wang Longde led investigation team. The person in charge of AIDS in Henan led fellow director, he did not want his hometown, \"fool\", Henan Health Minister reported to the central through false epidemic investigation team. Later investigations nothing, even some who are still quietly conscientious investigation. Who is daring the large number of people infected with HIV in Henan major outbreaks have been reported pressure down, as well as investigations halfway waste? ! Unscrupulous persecution of whistleblowers to \"seal\" the AIDS outbreak in Henan critical juncture, Henan those in power than to control the spread of the disease in the first place, but the whistleblower must first unplug considered eyesores, evil in order to achieve the purpose of concealing the epidemic. The first report Zhoukou area HIV outbreak Wang Shuping, found that local Shangshui West 赵桥村 many people appear AIDS-like symptoms, after she sold blood to detect blood personnel, more than 60% of HIV-positive, but Henan Zhoukou area and the authorities do not recognize her test. Blood samples were then sent to Beijing Wang, chief expert of the Academy with the help of the AIDS community Zeng Yi, Wang sent 62 blood samples tested in Beijing 16 servings, 13 individuals were positive. Zeng Yi shocked, immediately let Wang Shuping report instantly communicated to the Ministry of Health and the Regional Health Authority Zhoukou of Henan Province and. However, not only did not pay attention Henan Wang found, but said she gave Henan \"broke a major earthquake,\" said, \"Why not find someone else, only you can find?!\" King of highly condemned by the series after more pressure, forced reluctantly had to leave in 1997 in Henan to Beijing \"refuge\" until later moved to the United States. When \"Southern Weekend\" 2005 report of the tenth anniversary of AIDS in Henan, said Wang Shuping was \"the first to discover the AIDS epidemic in Henan hero.\" Following the disclosure of the AIDS epidemic in Henan Province Wang Shuping is \"the first person of Chinese folk AIDS prevention,\" said Dr. Gao Henan Province. As she speak up, the truth courage exposure AIDS epidemic, severely persecuted by the authorities in Henan Province. Gao is a professor of medicine Henan authority. She started in 1996 to over 100 in-depth serious epidemic of AIDS villages, mastered a lot of first-hand material. She knew a serious problem. In the case of a tight blockade of the epidemic in Henan, her real facts reveal the truth to the outside world, used \"stand before the most\" cases wrote \"Blood plague 10000 letters: AIDS epidemic reveal the true face of China,\" \"My AIDS prevention Road \"and\" noble soul: Gao memoirs, \"and several books, let the world know who put hundreds of thousands of humble farmers into the grave. As the official work negatively, Gao put one million yuan of personal savings and prizes donated for AIDS Songyisongyao and issued propaganda. She angered the authorities in Henan, where they maintain the image, as well as the protection of state secrets to foreign anti-China forces to use the high grounds of high pressure. After the ruling, Henan Li Keqiang, fear of AIDS epidemic in Henan Gao leaked out, once his house arrest, limit her contact with the outside world so high for 2001 and 2003 did not take place on several occasions to go abroad to accept the award. Henan authorities because of unbearable persecution, in 2009 she finally to flee to the U.S. as a visiting scholar. The third persecution is well-known AIDS activist Wan Yanhai scholars and education. He was in power at the time of Li Henan boldly open to the outside world the truth of the AIDS epidemic in Henan Province, in 2002 was the National Security Ministry door with \"leaking state secrets\" as an excuse to arrest, police department in 2006 was imprisoned again. 2008 Henan police twice in his Inquiries framed him in the \"two sessions\" of the same year to organize the Henan infected persons to Tiananmen Square self-immolation. He was for many years the police to track and monitor, monitor, and numerous interference until emigrated to the U.S.. To prevent leakage of the epidemic in critically ill patients regardless of life and death, the province rejected the first one to enter the specialist rescue Henan provinces hardest hit by the AIDS village doctor Shangcai text is authoritative AIDS prevention expert, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Division of Infectious Diseases Director Gui Professor Sheehan. He was in August 1999 because of Henan has caused many people have died of AIDS in Henan Greatly panic field research. Gui 11 blood samples drawn at first to do HIV testing, the results of 10 positive; Then he extracted 140 blood samples, HIV-positive rate of 62%. After several local officials Gui reflect these circumstances, but have been refused. In order to save lives and to find out the epidemic, Gui Xien from 1999 to 2004, more than 30 times their own expense to many villages in Henan Songyisongyao, for a large number of AIDS patients suspected to do testing, funded 58 orphans to stay in school; also 5 AIDS were receiving their own home, ate together. These charges are from his personal savings. Since Gui Xien dedication and pioneering work, the British Bankers' Mr. Martin • Gordon of the 2003 International AIDS Prevention Award \"Bailey - Martin Award\" awarded Gui Xien. November 2004, the U.S. \"Time\" rating him as \"medical hero.\" Since Li Keqiang time to worry about the introduction of foreign aid Henan ruling would deliberately woven mesh to break the blockade, and therefore outside the province to the rescue of all health workers refused, resulting in difficulties intensified. Gui Xien destroyed because of the \"local image\", he was declared \"persona non grata.\" Gui Xien June 2001 with more than 10,000 yuan in Henan drugs alone into the village, the local government sent the police after hearing the expulsion. Several farmers and to inform him hide Gui midnight motorcycle took him to the train station, only to enable him to \"escape.\" Then a silly does not regret the AIDS clinic doctors are experts in Beijing, deputy director Zhang You An Hospital physician, he is also ruled during Li Keqiang, started in 1999 in Henan Henan rescue. Zhang August 1999 Xincai from Henan to Beijing for treatment of AIDS patients at that, Henan awful lot of death appeared unexplained. The patient was gone, he immediately went to the new CAI. Zhang depth five consecutive years hundreds of AIDS villages in Henan Province, a large collection of first-hand information, write the facts fully, credible and strong, valuable \"Survey of Henan AIDS five years.\" He concluded that if the epidemic in Henan outset rather than to conceal the public, that disaster can be controlled in the bud. Since 1999, Zhang and co-operation in Henan grassroots village doctor for 40 villages over 10,000 AIDS cases, investigation and analysis, this process mortality rate of 30.2%; 3% of patients due to intolerable pain and lack of treatment in despair suicide. Henan foul case so from a purely public health events, evolved into the death of a large area of ​​humanitarian disaster. Zhang's actions violated Henan, he was accused of affecting the image of Henan. More people can not understand that the Ministry of Health does not organize the rescue teams went to Henan, contrary to the Health Department of Henan Province, the Ministry of Health Zhang sued the letter forwarded to the rescue You An Hospital, Henan, Zhang asked the hospital to stop the action . Hospital, the hospital said, whoever who go to Henan on sanctions. Ministry of Health so respectable \"fireman\" is not only not protected, but standing \"AIDS director,\" while abetting the expulsion Zhang, this is the Ministry of Health do! Zhang did not give up, as long as the ward things much, he would depart on Friday, back to Beijing Monday morning to go to work a full eight years ago. \"No-fault\" theory \"came out\" a deliberate foul case exemption Henan Henan foul sinister plot investigation has been the case dragged on without astonishment, but more than that. In recent years, some people name China Red Ribbon \"AIDS Human Rights Forum\" banner at the top behest, Henan foul case actually showed so-called \"no-fault\" liability theory. They altered the idea, an attempt to Henan to this important case without someone in charge of the \"no-fault\" for the victims of the \"compensation\" to not be held at fault, \"no-fault compensation.\" Through this dramatic attempt to change easily become the case does not have to be held in Henan foul trivial one, so it should be held criminally responsible Henan foul case \"quick change\" to a big comeback. Pick head made this strange theory than others, but with Henan foul inextricably implicated in the case, when the person in charge of the Ministry of Health in charge of HIV prevention work and ministerial level officials and the head of the Division of AIDS Prevention and Control Office in. They put forward the \"no-fault\" theory, first attempt to LIU Quan-xi, and Li Changchun and Li Keqiang owe \"blood\" written off, another mystery hidden for themselves and harboring serious misconduct and favoritism in this incident, \"Minister AIDS\" LIU Quan-xi, lead to disaster deterioration absolve responsibility. Beijing Institute NGO AIZHIXING held once noted, \"AIDS Human Rights Forum\" message, the organization more than 30 victims of Henan to Beijing to attend the meeting, pointed out that Henan foul case evidence, to escape accountability have enough corrupt, and start \"perpetrating a fraud\" Pipedream dream, ulterior motive, can not escape responsibility. \"Double delay\" and painful consequences \"double high\" heartbreaking result after the outbreak of HIV in Henan Province, a large number of infected patients 5-8 years after diagnosis of infection. Since the onset of the infected person has been diagnosed too late and the treatment of late, which is delayed diagnosis and delayed treatment \"double delay\" resulting in a large number of infected persons lose the best timing of treatment, premature death. Together because of \"selling blood\" and hospital \"blood transfusion therapy,\" which led to two aspects of the AIDS virus, \"high-prevalence\" and \"double delay\" caused by \"high mortality rate\" two \"double high\" is the cause of medical aid Hysteresis of serious default. A large number of AIDS patients in a critical period in power Li Henan, Henan Province and the Ministry of Health did not provide timely early to seriously ill patients in good efficacy, side effects have been highly recommended was the world that can make a lot of on the brink of death in AIDS patients the disease will quickly improved antiviral drugs lamivudine therapy backbone. This is far behind with a \"BRICS\" concerns the livelihood of Brazil, as well as in the critical period for many years, the vast majority of patients in Henan have almost eliminated in developed countries taking the poor efficacy, side effects of medications, some of this can be get treatment to save lives lost opportunity, resulting in a surprising number of unusual deaths. Party cadres Li repeatedly pressing the four former members of the provincial Commission for Discipline Inspection Report Henan Province since September 2004, Li insisted on serious misconduct caused by hundreds of thousands of HIV-infected persons, and many died due to severe lack of treatment question, the Politburo and other departments to sue. Decision-makers to put this report pressed down, He Guoqiang and Wang Gang appoint two members of the Politburo for Discipline Inspection officials accuse Li of strong pressure. Henan Province Commission for Discipline Inspection, NPC deputies and CPPCC members for a total of 33 years ago, resulting in 22 cases the cause of foul Henan province nearly 25 million people infected with HIV, the court charged with a serious crime problem malfeasance Li Changchun, but have been suppressed. Henan year there are more than 200, to levels Discipline cadres and retired personnel and other departments jointly sent a letter to the commission, Li Changchun report for the period from 1992 to 1998, five withhold 12 regions of Henan responsibility to pursue the AIDS outbreak reports. But not only did not pursue Li Changchun, Li but was \"Bole\" phase into the Politburo, and with misdeeds in turn Henan Provincial Party Secretary of Guangdong, and later promoted to the Politburo Standing Committee. Such achievements, but by the way care soaring, it not strange? ! Can not erase the stain of history after the First Li Keqiang ruled Henan, Li tried to cover up serious misdeeds, and to conceal the Henan blood curse as their common goal. Second, in connivance Li Keqiang, Henan Province, Henan epidemic of courage to expose the truth outside the three celebrities to implement more stringent measures of persecution, forcing them to reluctantly leave China. Third Period ruled Henan Li Keqiang, the persecution of the petitioners was extremely severity. Xi Ge infected with HIV through blood transfusion after his two daughters were also infected after the eldest daughter died of AIDS. Her petition on persecution in power at the time, Li Changchun, Li Keqiang in power after the petition was again detained for 21 days. 9 years old Tian Xi HIV infection also are petitioning the government during the two after when Vice Premier Li Keqiang has been sentenced to one year in prison to continue appealing.赵凤霞 transfusion infected with HIV due to childbirth and transmitted to the child and her husband, after her husband died of AIDS. Her petition for years to no avail, since January 2012 and in February was sentenced to two years in prison to continue to appeal. Foreign media such oppressive acts lashed around the globe. As a national leader Li Keqiang does not know. From professional ethics is concerned, as a \"competent prevention and treatment of AIDS,\" the officials should have feelings of AIDS patients, however, in order to ensure the official post of \"incorrigible,\" the petitioners, detained and imprisoned by the \"stability maintenance\" means \"prevention\", all \" Shoudaobingchu. \" This is the same government office in the history of the practice of cruel oppression without 辜小民 What's the difference? ! Fourth, when Li Keqiang in power Henan, Henan outbreak of severe blockade can be described to be added. Former newspaper reporter Zhang Jicheng, Henan Science and Technology, in January 2000 in the \"Huaxi Dushi Bao\" published an exclusive report, \"hundreds of people infected with\" abnormal \"mystery\", the first kick was blocked as long as six years to the world The HIV epidemic in Henan Shangcai Wenlou truth, thus breaking the Henan authorities in an attempt to fool the public opinion of the dream, so that the village has saved hundreds of thousands of AIDS hope, Zhang Jicheng exposure significance. Henan AIDS village \"culture village\" have become synonymous with world-famous. But his actions make Henan authorities angrily, under the Henan Provincial Party Committee Propaganda Department issued a document: \"dismissal Zhang Jicheng.\" The dedication to work of journalists who lost their jobs were forced to stray from Beijing. Henan Province \"newspaper\", \"Zhengzhou Evening News\" and \"City Morning\" there are a number of reporters for committing \"forbidden zone\" suffered catastrophe. Li and Li Changchun, Henan blood curse on concealing the problem so the same boat, allied to birds of a feather, but he was actually the best candidate for the next prime minister. Li Keqiang is in power after five Henan Kaifeng as the year if arbiter as Untouchables, will make many farmers have received a positive HIV treatment, but also make him a significant ethical politicians at a critical moment. Party Secretary Li Chen Kuiyuan after Wei Jianxing and former secretary of the commission had a history of motion investigated LIU Quan-xi, because resistance is large and can not. Li Keqiang, if there are such considerations would be another situation. During this period the foreign media constantly emerging new disclosure Henan AIDS village in Li Keqiang after taking office, because of the report and the suppression of petitioners upgrade, make him into disrepute. This is not \"stealing black dog, white dog when disaster.\" Henan due to conceal the serious consequences resulting from the epidemic has become a dirty Li Keqiang, How can we allow bullying to conceal days. Background must escape \"aegis\" is known under the accountability of officials to justice, to conceal the epidemic occurred in China led to serious consequences \"SARS (ie SARS) outbreak case\", \"Hebei Sanlu tainted milk case\" and \" 7.23 Wenzhou train crash \"and other public safety incidents have been dealt with eventually. Henan alone more serious case was an exception foul. Guanguanxianghu institutional ills, is caused by the total root cause of this corruption of power. With negligence can dare to bear responsibility, is a minimum requirement for officials of integrity. State leaders should have more charity, social commitment of conduct. However, Li Changchun and Li Keqiang, but rely on the mighty \"patron\" of bullying, the countless victims of officialdom as a stepping stone to climb, put on a dazzling aura of national leaders. By now, they are victims, especially unjustly 100,000 souls, is the meaning of repentance and atonement are not. They ripped fig leaf is exposed dirty mind. Henan Case foul delays punished with years of history and legacy of the other two major events, the three big events from the Chinese government difficult to heal wounds. Dire straits faced hundreds of thousands of victims in Henan, the ruling party and the Chinese government, Li Changchun and Li Keqiang has not even a \"no\" did not say a word. No matter whatever it wants while, depending on the deceased was worthless life of many victims and it was above all the interests of the rich and powerful swallowed. Along with many serious problems currently rampant corruption and fight to suppress the legitimate interests of freedom demands of people's livelihood, such as exists, is tantamount to send a clear signal to the ruling party, blindly condoning, will lead to the collapse of the ruling party utilities fall short, the ruling of the building will occur in an instant. History can not be distorted, evil can not be bleached. \"Plasma economy\" bloody sins liquidated sooner or later, and nailed to shame. Only the ruling trend of the times, to re-examine and restore history, devoid of humanity's filing asked his disciples contemptible criminal liability, compensation and pension given to all victims of tainted blood case is still effective in treating survivors with legal protection, but also fair victims to thank the world in order to appease the resentment, popular, out of trouble. Shen Zhou thousands of junks sail past the million trees ahead of the spring wood. Sincerely hope that a turning point in 18th CCP greatly, starts with one, in the layout of the new leaders, good and evil, in the political reform did not hesitate to take the outrageous case of Henan foul surgery, will be a major drag on for years solve the problem in 2012.

In fact, influenza is a French term coined in the 18th century until 1933, when the virus (H1N1, also originating from pigs, but very different from what would cause 90 years after swine flu) was isolated, it was not known what caused it. - speculated until they were bacteria.\n\n\n\nVictims: between 40 and 50 million people between 1918 and 1919.\n\nOrigin: Came consumption and handling of contaminated meat of chimpanzees in Africa. Although the virus has been identified only in 1983, blood samples collected in Africa in 1959 and the U.S. frozen already containing the virus was discovered.\n\n\n\nVictims:. 25 million deaths since 1981 Currently, there are 33 million people living with the virus\n\n\n\nWhy it's dangerous: It was a more frightening disease. With new treatments, their mortality has been dropping. There were 3 million deaths in 2000 and 1.8 million in 2009. Most deaths are located in countries without access to modern antiviral treatments.\n\nSource: The devastating virus - \"he does in ten days what it takes HIV ten years,\" wrote Richard Preston in the book Hot Zone - appeared in Congo and Sudan, in 1976, with a remarkably high rate of mortality. In both countries, 602 cases and 431 deaths were recorded. Most cases come from direct contact with non-human primates such as chimpanzees, gorillas, and other wildlife such as antelope and porcupines.\n\n\n\nVictims: 1,850 cases, 1,200 deaths.\n\n\n\nWhy is it dangerous: Transmitted by blood and secretions, destroys the body's defense cells and platelets, causing bleeding brutal.\n\nOrigin: From the same family as Ebola virus (filovirus), also causes Marburg hemorrhagic fever. Was identified away from Africa, Marburg, Germany. Behring laboratory technicians who produced the polio vaccine received contaminated Uganda monkeys (after it was discovered that almost half of the dead monkeys came from Uganda, victim bleeding). Mortality was high among technicians: 31 were sickened and seven died.\n\n\n\nVictims: 569 cases, 467 deaths (82% mortality). The largest outbreak occurred in Angola between 2004 and 2005: 374 cases, with 329 deaths.\n\n\n\nWhy is it dangerous: The same reasons of Ebola. Apart from the devastating effects it has a long incubation period - 3-9 days ago - and can infect everyone who has contact with the patient through secretions and blood.\n\nOrigin: Although the cause hemorrhagic fever, Marburg and Ebola as the Lassa is another family of viruses, arenaviruses (transmitted by rodents). Gained the name because its first victims were two American nuns who coordinated a school in the town of Lassa, Nigeria.\n\n\n\nVictims: According to estimates, the number of cases varies between 300,000 and 500,000 per year, in West Africa, with 5,000 deaths.\n\n\n\nWhy is it dangerous: Despite the reduced mortality rate of 1%, kills 80% of pregnant women or the fetus if contracted in the third trimester of pregnancy. By having a large incubation period - 7 to 10 days - can infect tourists, who lead the disease to their countries of origin. The disease has appeared in the USA, Canada, Israel, Japan, Germany, UK and the Netherlands.\n\nSource: The avian influenza virus was first isolated in 1996, on a farm in Guangdong province, China. The following year, the first cases appeared in Hong Kong: 18 infected, 6 deaths. It is transmitted by contact with birds. If one day the virus 'learn' to pass from human to human by the respiratory route, can become the most devastating flu of all time.\n\n\n\nVictims: Until the day August 31, 2011, 565 cases and 331 deaths (58.6% mortality, a very high rate) were recorded.\n\n\n\nWhy is it dangerous: It's a flu that kills more than half of those infected. Luckily, it is only transmitted from human to human in exceptional cases.\n\nOrigin: In 2009, the virus has found a way to let the pigs and also infect humans, triggering a pandemic from North America. The world was startled by how quickly swine flu progressed (74 months in a few countries). In Brazil, the antiviral Tamiflu, which fights disease, disappeared from the pharmacies. Today, H1N1 is one of the annual flu variants, along with H3N2 and influenza B.\n\n\n\nVictims: In 2009, killed 44,100 people in the U.S., 47,800 against the common flu.\n\n\n\nWhy is it dangerous: He kills unless the common cold, but it takes more years of life. While seasonal flu kills more elderly, swine flu reaches more children and pregnant women.\n\nSource: In Malaysia, bats containing the virus dropped half-chewed fruit breeding of pigs that ate the fruit. Handlers contracted the virus while having contact with the feces of animals, running a hand in his pants and taking to the face, for example. Was the virus that inspired the creation of the fictional MEV-1 in the movie Contagion\n\n\n\nVictims: The mortality was above 50%. Of the 475 cases registered, 251 people died\n\n\n\nWhy it's dangerous: Causes encephalitis (brain inflammation) deadly in most cases. When not kill, can leave deep sequelae, such as frequent seizures and personality changes\n\nWhen it appeared: 1990\n\n\n\nSource: Won this name for infecting a woman who was visiting her parents in the Garden Thrush in Cotia, in São Paulo. Within four days, the patient died. The virus also infected three people, two laboratory technicians who were exposed to the blood of the victim and an operator of a coffee machine in the Holy Spirit. To date not found the transmitter animal, but knows that it is a rodent.\n\n\n\nVictims: 4 people, 4 deaths.\n\n\n\nWhy is it dangerous: The proximity of Cotia with São Paulo, about 20 kilometers, shows that an epidemic can get away from the same jungle where usually this kind of virus comes into contact with humans.\n\nOrigin: The origin of dengue is deforestation. With the advancement of man in wild regions, the mosquito that transmits dengue began to sting humans. There are four different types of viruses, all with the same symptoms and the same form of treatment. The source is also the same: Southeast Asia.\n\n\n\nVictims: Around 500,000 people need to be hospitalized because of dengue hemorrhagic fever - 2.5% die.\n\n\n\nWhy is it dangerous: A person can get infected with dengue normal, one in which the symptoms are mild or moderate and then turn into a hemorrhagic fever, in which the blood vessels are damaged, causing bleeding."},{"id":"532ca59af99fe75cf5384e4b","translation":" View printable version Share this post: Published Date: 2012-05-13 21:26:37 Subject: PRO / AH> severe acute disease, unknown cause outbreak in prison - Brazil (MG) Archive Number: SEVERE ACUTE 20120514.252428ENFERMEDAD, CAUSE UNKNOWN , OUTBREAK IN PRESIDIO - BRAZIL (MG) ***************************************** ************* A ProMED-mailhttp :/ / www.promedmail.orgProMED-mail is a program of Diseases lasociedad Infecciosashttp :/ / www.isid.orgFecha: 11 May , 2012Fuente: Folha de São Paulo, Brazil <http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/1089344-surto-de-doenca-desconhecida-causa-duas-mortes-em-presidio-de-mg.shtml> [Edited by J.

The study, which used data from the World Health Organization (WTO) as a basis for comparison, said that \"China has the largest number of MDR TB cases in the world, a quarter of all cases worldwide.\" Data were collected in a study of more than 4,600 Chinese who had been recently diagnosed or treated for tuberculosis. In China one million new cases each year, which represents a large part of the estimated nine million who are diagnosed worldwide annually occur. Formally known as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the disease is spread through the air when infected people cough and spit the bacteria. Tuberculosis kills 1.5 million people worldwide each year. Although it can often be cured with antibiotics, even when the availability of drugs is limited in developing countries, sometimes patients do not follow treatment altogether, which can encourage the advancement of resistant strains.

But more worrying is the fact that most of the 110,000 cases of resistant TB were new patients diagnosed with the disease, suggesting that the virulent bacteria is being transmitted from one person to another and does not develop solely as a result of a individual stop taking treatment prematurely.

On this fast track, nice corner beyond to make up for the delayed start, the Chinese remarkable speed. In the face of this prism, the numerous diverse social spectrum outline ecology, Chinese growth is also entangled. Coincides with the transition period of opportunity, on this piece of land, prominent contradictions. Development problems can only be resolved by the development. Each step in China, we need to step down in the soil solid step, even if the road is not flat, or even muddy. Years, the transformation of tangled, Chinese face. Decade, China's growth, the world witnessed. Calmly and in a hurry, pain being more difficult to grow and prosperous. Temporary classrooms in Beichuan Middle School, Premier Wen Jiabao wrote on the blackboard side of the four characters. A painting, engraved in the hearts of every Chinese person. Stand tough character and backbone, giving this nation the courage to face the critical moment, to give this country the strength to carry the weight of a disaster. Infectious diseases, earthquake, torrential mudslides, severe snow storms and other natural disasters, China calmly, the people unite ...... decades, we have won the victory again and again. However, when disaster suddenly upon the beginning, the people of this land have a loss. In 2003, a highly lethal new virus almost defeated the defense of life, the absence of information to blur the grim situation, the emergency system to adapt to rapidly changing weak yet the epidemic. People in the throes awakened, followed by a series of self-reform and institution building. Experience, learned in pain; grow, completed in tangled. When the tests come again, calmly have a spectrum. In 2008, the \"5.12\" Wenchuan after the earthquake a few minutes, the first time the national news agency released information showing clear progress in earthquake relief. 2009, H5N1 outbreaks once looked up contingency plans for the effective functioning of health and disease prevention and control mechanism, so that transmission of the virus lost the raging power. In 2010, torrential mudslides in Zhouqu night raid, institutional advantages in the reconstruction of the filling, so Gannan town in a year writing the rebirth of the legendary Jedi. In 2012, Beijing torrential rain in the deceased's name was read out one by one, the meaning of life to get respect. No history of a great catastrophe which is not a historical progress as compensation. This compensation, to reflect progress from every post. Today, people ask ...... you issue a new strong, tough enough in this country. Your passion, this country only temperature. Solving difficult exploration, interaction among growth, \"I feel both happy and sad.\" Hui Tang out of the White Horse ridge Labor Camp in Zhuzhou City, Hunan, takes a fine voice, like a mosquito flying, his hands clasped together. Opinion get a response. Delicate voice behind Hui Tang, citizens loud sound. Nine years ago, Sun Zhigang was not this lucky. In the streets of Guangzhou, he was regarded as \"three non-officers' housing, but no chance to come out. His consideration of life, stimulate discussion community, and ultimately led to the implementation of the 21-year detention and repatriation way to be abolished. This decade, the government has accumulated wisdom of social management, the pursuit of justice is no change of scale. People know that the voice of the media, the public's attention, not to reduce the \"error correction\" in price. The spirit of the rule of law, fair procedures, is a powerful guarantee. This law, protection of the rights of citizens, bound by the executive authorities. This decade, the government and the people in the interaction grow together. Government learning dialogue and avoid the tendency simple disposal, public defenders learn to generate social forces of reason. Public power for fear of civil rights, became chief \"correcting\" the opportunity, will also become the ruling confident characterization. Shifang tangle experienced major decisions in the national economy, public information, participation and decision increasingly attention. Wukan experienced exploration in dialogue and consultation to resolve conflicts, the government department trying to find the path of scientific judgment and flexible management. You do not silence, this country really sound. You are wise, this country was more emboldened. Thoughtful read minds, confidence among the growing Aug. 15, 2012, Hong Kong Diaoyu Islands boat \"Richland II\" succeeded in reaching the Diaoyu Islands, the flag is raised on the island. Just 98 days ago, the five-star red flag raised in Huangyan island. Intolerable, no longer forbear! Declaration of sovereignty series, revealing the people can not wait to show the mentality of great power status. Decade, China has become the world's second largest economy, rising great power status, but there is always the gap with the national mentality. However, the country does not default so powerful Western, per capita GDP is still far behind, still is a real developing countries to develop the main line determines the peaceful and stable environment is still present inevitable choice. Not only diplomacy, contemporary China in many areas, the rise of great powers and the powers of the national mentality Lost in parallel. We have 5,000 years of Chinese civilization, but in the field of Chinese and Western discourse, Hollywood and the Western media is still the leader; in \"Mei-US\" event, \"Little Yue Yue\" incident, the public is surprised at the fall festival parade of traditional morality, call the stick to the bottom line. When the grand narrative of individual countries into microscopic description, we can still see those efforts and assured insisted: \"free lunch\" program at ease walking charity is \"the most beautiful mother\" inadvertently, is every ordinary person in abide job on their own. This decade, we lunar exploration projects, such as vast and proud, but also learned to lose Olympic gold by tolerance and comfort; this decade, we continue to learn from the West excellent place more emphasis on the traditional value system of self-discovery and return; this decade, national mentality in the tangle, but growing. Do you have confidence in this country was more confident. You have the power, the country was more powerful. Pragmatic manage the family, which is a growing quest among ordinary Chinese family dinner table chat: difficult and expensive to go to school, high prices, price rises ...... every problem, but also affects the Zhongnanhai are always nervous. More and more farmers into the city, increasing urbanization rate, the household registration system in the end how to change? An aging population increasingly obvious how supporting family planning policy? Run, but inflation wage increases, and how income distribution reform? This is the reality of China, revealing social contradictions of the transition period, various interest demands entanglements, so to solve every problem can not do one or the other style choices. Today's world, there is no such a large country like China, so complicated. However, this decade, there are problems, there are also solving exploration. Growth, structural adjustment, GDP is not the only measure of performance, and environmental protection, well-being gradually into the evaluation system of some governments. Continue to improve the social security system to cover the whole system has taken significant steps, by the end of 2011, the basic medical insurance coverage continues to expand, 1.3 billion urban and rural residents insured, universal health care system formed. In 2012, the social security system covering urban and rural residents in China's major systems will be basically established, hundreds of millions of urban and rural residents will be included in the social insurance system. Actively adjust income distribution, rural per capita net income growth continues to improve, the country generally more substantial increase in the minimum wage, for seven consecutive years to improve the basic pension for enterprise retirees. Of course, this decade, the impact of institutional long-term healthy development of economic and social structural problems still exist, especially in some key areas and key links have not yet made a real breakthrough. The face of difficulties, you and I will have individual powerlessness, but it is undeniable, and no system can be perfect, and no measures to resolve the problem completely. China today, the need is not a simple bar to drink, is not a simple copy and paste, but the courage to face tangled, tangled dismantling of wisdom, for the unity of tangled constructive. You down to earth, this country will be more robust. You aggressive, this country will be more sunshine.

The reason - the drought that struck the main grain regions, as well as the heat caused mass flight locust invasion webworm caterpillars and other pests that could greatly affect crop yields. Nevertheless, experts suggest that it will be sold abroad some 20 million tons of grain.\nThe fact that Russia has no plans to enter duty or other restrictions on grain exports, wrote in his Twitter microblog Deputy Prime Minister Arkady Dvorkovich. Previously talked about this, President Vladimir Putin. Last year, the government discussed the possibility of limiting the introduction of fees, if exports will reach 24-25 million tons. These indicators on the basis of 2011-2012 agricultural year beginning July 1, exceeded this amount, but the restrictions have not been.\nRecently, Russian Agriculture Minister Nikolai Fyodorov said the new agricultural season in terms of grain production and export capacity of the country will be more modest than last year. In the season 2011/2012 in Russia were harvested 94.2 million tons of grain, of which exports were sold to 27 million tons. This year, the Ministry of Agriculture expects grain harvest will not exceed 85 million tons, and export capacity of 20 million tons.\nOne of the causes of poor crop species on - heat waves, set in the central and southern regions of Russia. The situation is that in some regions was introduced a state of emergency. This was first done, Rostov and Stavropol Territory. According to the regional government, the damage suffered by farmers of five districts of the Rostov region is estimated at 247.3 million rubles. The drought killed crops on an area of ​​83.6 hectares, which is 2.8% of the total sown area. In general, given the fodder and technical crops sowings deaths occurred over an area of ​​200 hectares. According to the Minister of Agriculture and Food of the region Vyacheslav Vasilenko, \"unfortunately, we are not able to collect 8 million tons of grain, like last year. Farm leaders say that approximately 25-30% below last year's harvest will be. \"\nIn the Stavropol region emergency mode introduced in eight districts. According to preliminary data, the drought that struck the east edge in April-May this year, damaged crops more than 111 hectares, the damage is estimated at more than 1.5 billion rubles.\nA very difficult situation in Kalmykia. Deputy Minister of Agriculture of the Republic Gennady Ragozin argues that the damage from the drought has already exceeded 500 million rubles, killing more than 111 thousand hectares of crops. \"Expected gross grain we planned within 400 tons, but because of the drought, according to preliminary balance will be about 185 million tons,\" - he said.\nIn the midst of the heat and was Voronezh region, where it is expected a 30 percent reduction in yield. According to first deputy head of the Department of Agrarian Policy Kvasova Alexander, because of the heat and lack of moisture harvest already killed nearly 100 hectares, the most affected crops.\nPreliminary damage from drought in the Volgograd region is estimated at 5 billion rubles, loss of crops is projected over an area of ​​600 hectares. As reported by Interfax in the regional Ministry of Agriculture, soil drought began on May 1 of this year and is still going on. This is compounded by abnormally high temperature. In Bashkortostan, the drought may cover at least 184 hectares, roughly estimated loss of 330 million rubles. The yield on the remaining areas will be 5-6 tons per hectare.\nWith the onset of hot weather, there were other enemies of the crop: grasshoppers and meadow moth. In Bashkortostan, they amazed crops over an area of ​​250 hectares. In Kurgan region webworm caterpillars hosted at two thousand hectares of farmland. Serious damage was caused to crops canola, corn, peas, potatoes and sunflower in six districts of the region. Local farmers pay attention to the fact that mass invasion webworm larvae observed in the Urals for the first time. Breeding insects have contributed to such weather conditions, like rain, and then install the 30-degree heat.\nIn the Chelyabinsk region due to locusts in four districts was introduced a state of emergency. In the Orenburg region 262.6 thousand hectares of crops pests amazed. In the Saratov region locusts ate half and crops Novouzensk Krasnokutsk areas. Currently 43% of fields with forage crops populated voracious insects, now held their chemical treatment.\nTherefore, today's estimates of future crops may be subject to a serious correction. According to the executive director of the analytical center \"Sovecon\" Andrei Sizov, forecasts for the harvest and export could be even lower, when there will be clear how much the drought affected the condition of grain in the eastern regions of Russia, especially in Siberia, where the collection will only begin next month.\nHowever, while market participants are optimistic. \"This year the drought was not universal, as it was a year ago, and the embargo on exports we do not expect,\" - noted in one of the major exporting companies.\n\n\n\nDate Posted: 09/07/2012 12:41:00"},{"id":"5330313ef99fe75cf538f88b","translation":"\n\n\n\n                ■ Video Screenshot: fungal infection steroids (1/1)\n            \n \n\n  As the 6th heat tracing, case by the United States since the injection of steroids and fungal infections of meningitis has infected more than 60 cases, the death toll rose to seven.

Since the air conditioning temperature is very desirable \"Legionella\" reproduction, plus air conditioning system and the water is recycled, so the main parasitic bacteria in the central air-conditioning and cooling water piping systems, cold and humid air conditioning system, and spray the The bacteria can be subjected to water contamination and spread through the air or drinking water, decreased immunity in the human body easily infected. According to the World Health Organization report, the current \"Legionnaires' disease\" has shown a worldwide distribution, and are likely to occur throughout the year.

Authorities had office buildings, hotels, shopping malls, hospitals and home air conditioning systems, and the results confirm that both the central air conditioning or split air and tank air conditioning, are able to detection of bacteria and fungi, all air conditioners are different degrees there is microbial contamination. Because these pathogenic microorganisms thrive in the appropriate air-conditioned environment, and through air conditioning water, air circulation spread, affecting the indoor environment, and thus there is a potential hazard to human health.

Subsequently, the pathogen migrates through the olfactory nerve to the central nervous system, causing PAM. Infection through ingestion of contaminated water does not occur. There is no person to person transmission.\n\n\n\nSigns and symptoms of PAM are generally similar to those observed in bacterial meningitis, thus being difficult to diagnose in the early stages. The incubation period is 5 days on average (varying from 1 to 7 days). Depending on the diagnosis difficult in the initial phase and rapidly progressive, most cases progress to death, usually 5 days after the onset of symptoms (ranging from 1 to 12 days).\n\n\n\nThe clinical picture in early stage (stage 1) include headache, fever, nausea and vomiting; with disease progression (stage 2), there is the presence of altered level of consciousness, hallucinations, convulsions, coma and death.\n\n\n\nAmong the cases reported there is a report of 2 patients (one in EUA/1979 and another in México/2003) who achieved cure. Although there is evidence that the strains involved were potentially less virulent, the therapeutic regimens used in the two situations have been mentioned as potential recommendations for the treatment of PAM:\n\nUSA: amphotericin B + rifampicin + Miconazole + dexamethasone + + sulfisoxazole phenytoin;\n\nMexico: amphotericin B + fluconazole + rifampicin + ceftriaxone + dexamethasone.\n\nCurrently there is in vitro evidence of the efficacy of miltefosine against _Naegleria fowleri_.\n\n\n\nThe diagnosis of PAM in 75% of cases is done in post-mortem examinations. The detection of the agent can be given by analysis of cerebrospinal fluid, biopsy or tissue fragments collected post mortem by PCR, culture and immunohistochemistry.\n\n\n\n(Source: http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/index.html)\n\n\n\nTo know the transmission cycle _Naegleria fowleri_, visit:\n\n# http://www.cdc.gov/parasites/naegleria/pathogen.html pathogen\n\n\n\n- Mod RNA\n\n\n\nTo find the post on HealthMap, visit:\n\nhttp://healthmap.org/promed/en?name=Karachi + Sindh, Pakistan + & p = 947 & g = 1174872 & v = 24.867,67.05,5,947; http://healthmap.org/r/1kc-\n\n\n\n- Mod RNA]\n\n\n\n[See also:\n\nProMED-PORT\n\n2012 - 15 years of ProMED-PORT.\n\n\n\nCollaborate with the goal 2000 subscribers: subscribe a friend or colleague in ProMED-PORT!\n\n \n\nVisit our website: http://www.promedmail.org/pt - LJS / RNA]\n\nRNA ................................................."},{"id":"532cbabbf99fe75cf538836e","translation":"\n\n        Thursday July 12, 2012 | 22:30\n        · Update: 22:30\n\nThe Araucanía Health authorities confirm 10 people infected with AH3N2 virus\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you feel about this news?\n0felicidad\n0sorpresa\n0indiferencia\n0tristeza\n0enojo\n\nHealth authorities in La Araucanía confirmed that 10 people are infected with the AH3N2 virus.\nRegional Ministerial Secretary of Health, Gloria Rodriguez, said there are serious cases and no patient remains hospitalized.\nJust as a warning from the World Health Organization this year there was a massive campaign with use of a trivalent vaccine, which protects against influenza AH1N1, AH3N2 virus began and B.\nPeople should be alert to the following symptoms, Gloria Rodriguez said.\n\nHealth officials estimate that in Araucanía over the next 15 days could result in an increase of people infected.\nYou may also be interested in\n\n\n\n\n\n"},{"id":"532cb01cf99fe75cf5386887","translation":"   Girona.

Data show that as of now, this year, the incidence of 34 cases of anthrax. Due to a lack of understanding of anthrax in some places there has been concern about the anthrax panic. Experts said that the incidence of anthrax is not high, it is not terrible, the public need not panic.\nWhen the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention recently released anthrax outbreak noted, anthrax is a relatively common diseases, generally caused by human contact with infected dead animals and their products, mainly to cutaneous anthrax. As long as early detection, early diagnosis and treatment, the cure rate is high, the prognosis is generally not leave sequelae and rarely death. If you suspect you may be infected with anthrax, should go to hospital for diagnosis.\nAnthrax is a zoonotic infectious diseases. Anthrax pathogen Bacillus anthracis can form spores, spores with strong resistance, can survive in the soil for many years substandard environment. In most cases, cattle and sheep grazing herbivores when ingested spores cause infection; sick animal blood, feces, milk and dead livestock offal, bones, etc., can directly infect humans or to the environment, to become human important source of infection. Contaminated animal products such as fur, etc. can also be a source of infection. Moderately susceptible to anthrax person, regardless of age and gender influence the onset, but the spread of anthrax among humans is rare.\nOf anthrax occurred in the western region to pastoral houses and more. Anthrax is a Class B infectious diseases, \"People's Republic of China Disease Prevention Act\" provisions, which according to the CPI pulmonary anthrax infectious disease management.\nThere are mainly three kinds of human infection with anthrax ways: First, by skin contact. If skin contact with contaminants will enter the body through tiny spores on the skin wound. Second, oral infections. Mainly due to the ingestion of contaminated food and infection, and eating habits and food processing. Third inhalation infection. Inhalation of dust and aerosol anthrax spores can cause pulmonary anthrax. Under normal circumstances the direct inhalation of infection is less common, occurring most commonly in fur processing plant workers.\nExperts pointed out that Bacillus anthracis are widely distributed in the world, and its growth without special culture conditions. In Bacillus anthracis spores can be formed under certain conditions. Highly heat-resistant spores in the external environment is very difficult death, can survive in the soil environment endures for many years, once the soil is contaminated, extremely difficult to remove. Place in the event of anthrax, the epidemic will continue to occur repeatedly, the general means of prevention is difficult to stop. Therefore, as an ancient disease anthrax, has never disappeared.\nAccording to the survey, most recently in Liaoning Province and other places of anthrax outbreaks, patients had contact with dead cattle slaughtered or experience, are common causes of morbidity naturally infected with anthrax.\nStatistics show that almost all of anthrax occurred or popular around the world, including Asia, most of Africa and parts of the Americas, there are endemic area. In developed countries, anthrax is rare in developing countries, is still a serious threat of anthrax infections. In China, anthrax, although the incidence is not high, but it is also not uncommon. In recent years, in hundreds of cases occur every year, from the last century to the present, a declining trend in the incidence of anthrax.\nExperts stressed that once yourself or someone suffering from anthrax around, do not panic, you should immediately report to the local health center or disease prevention and control institutions, seek immediate medical attention. Note that the patient's excretions, secretions disinfected or incinerated.\nThe major source of anthrax infection died herbivores, if found cattle sheep and other animals died suddenly, his mouth, nose, anus, etc. coagulation of the blood is not flowing, do not peel the food should be immediately reported to the local agricultural livestock sector. Dead animals on treatment to comply with the requirements from the source to prevent the occurrence of anthrax. Purchased through the formal channels of beef and mutton are to undergo quarantine, cooked cooking cooking can be safe to eat. Experts stressed that the most important thing is to prevent infection is not contagious sources.\nFor anthrax infection does not occur between people say, experts pointed out that under natural circumstances, this infection is rare indeed, but it does not mean there is no danger. According to reports, after people suffering from anthrax, Bacillus anthracis can be excreted through certain means. In cutaneous anthrax ulcer edge exudate, often detachable bacteria; lot of intestinal anthrax bacteria excreted. The reason that less prone to human transmission, because people do not have easy access to anthrax bacteria discharge, less the amount of cutaneous anthrax bacteria discharged, the ulcer has been particularly evident, people will pay attention to avoid contact, while the incidence of other types of anthrax very low.\nExperts stressed that the provisions of anthrax must be isolated country, aimed at preventing the spread of environmental pollution expand.

This virus carried by the bird, with mosquito bites to humans. West Nile virus infection in humans is usually the case, there are two light levels occur in patients with flu-like symptoms such as headache, fatigue, joint pain, rash or swollen lymph nodes even; If the degree of patients with severe, the virus may infringe nervous system, causing encephalitis symptoms, severe life-threatening.\nChen Zhong Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital of Infectious Diseases experts also told us that this virus belongs to the Flaviviridae, genus yellow fever virus, Japanese encephalitis, and we are familiar with, hepatitis C, dengue fever are in fact the same categories. Symptoms of West Nile virus and Japanese encephalitis can cause somewhat similar, to cause the most concern is that it has the characteristics of addicted to the central nervous system, more prone to damage the central nervous system. Generally, infants, the elderly, there are some inherent defects in the immune system of people likely to be infected with West Nile; apart from humans, birds, there are some animals such as horses will also be infected.

In this regard, Zheng Yiping said that the public need not worry, because \"Nanjing mosquitoes do not pass this disease.\"\nAccording to Zheng Yiping introduced in Nanjing attacks mosquitoes bite humans there are five kinds, namely Culex mosquito, Aedes albopictus, three Culex, Anopheles subalbatus and China. Among these, three Culex is the main disseminator JE, Culex mosquito can transmit Japanese encephalitis virus; sinensis is the culprit of people infected with malaria. In addition, Aedes albopictus is thought to spread dengue, but it is not the spread of dengue fever \"main force\", dengue in the southern region mainly rely on active dissemination of Aedes aegypti, the local dengue patients also extremely rare. As for West Nile virus, local mosquito population, and it does not matter much, so people do not have to worry too much.\nIn addition, some people worry that if such patients carry the virus back, local mosquitoes suck the blood of the patient, it will not become \"infected mosquito,\" it led to the spread of West Nile virus in the local response, Zheng a flat is also clear that there will not be such a situation. \"West Nile virus is not spread from person to person, even after the patient bite mosquito bites someone else, it will not cause the latter to be infected.\"\nTherefore, only recently been infected people require special vigilance. Since West Nile virus vaccine inoculation No, if the public recently to the United States Texas region, once the flu-like symptoms should immediately go to the hospital for medical treatment, while you've been sure to tell the doctor the situation in these areas, to facilitate the doctor investigation take treatment as soon as possible.\nIn addition, mosquitoes are active in summer and autumn seasons, although there is no West Nile, mosquito bites can still bring a lot of health problems, so people should still take anti-mosquito measures to avoid mosquito bites, including the use of pesticides, dawn and dusk Avoid going out when mosquitoes are rampant, wear long trousers, using screens to prevent mosquitoes entering the house and removing stagnant water around the residence and so on.\nJinling Evening News reporter Zhu Jingjing reported\nSource: Jinling Evening News Editor: Sun Jing\n\n"},{"id":"532ce108f99fe75cf538e216","translation":"White moth strikes is currently the best treatment opportunity\nHengshui News Network - Hengshui Evening News (Reporter Zhu Wei) 15, the reporter learned from the Forestry Bureau of Hengshui City, is currently the third generation of fall webworm started coming downtown for green cause some harm.

Data show that as of now, this year, the incidence of 34 cases of anthrax. Due to a lack of understanding of anthrax in some places there has been concern about the anthrax panic. Experts said that the incidence of anthrax is not high, it is not terrible, the public need not panic. Herbivores is an important source of infection when the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention recently released anthrax outbreak noted, anthrax is a relatively common infectious disease, usually caused by human contact with infected dead animals and their products, mainly to cutaneous anthrax. As long as early detection, early diagnosis and treatment, the cure rate is high, the prognosis is generally not leave sequelae and rarely death. If you suspect you may be infected with anthrax, should go to hospital for diagnosis. Anthrax is a zoonotic infectious diseases. Anthrax pathogen Bacillus anthracis can form spores, spores with strong resistance, can survive in the soil for many years substandard environment. In most cases, cattle and sheep grazing herbivores when ingested spores cause infection; sick animal blood, feces, milk and dead livestock offal, bones, etc., can directly infect humans or to the environment, to become human important source of infection. Contaminated animal products such as fur, etc. can also be a source of infection. Moderately susceptible to anthrax person, regardless of age and gender influence the onset, but the spread of anthrax among humans is rare. Of anthrax occurred in the western region to pastoral houses and more. Anthrax is a Class B infectious diseases, \"People's Republic of China Disease Prevention Act\" provisions, which according to the CPI pulmonary anthrax infectious disease management. There are mainly three kinds of human infection with anthrax ways: First, by skin contact. If skin contact with contaminants will enter the body through tiny spores on the skin wound. Second, oral infections. Mainly due to the ingestion of contaminated food and infection, and eating habits and food processing. Third inhalation infection. Inhalation of dust and aerosol anthrax spores can cause pulmonary anthrax. Under normal circumstances the direct inhalation of infection is less common, occurring most commonly in fur processing plant workers. Hundreds of cases occur annually experts pointed out that Bacillus anthracis widely distributed in the world, and its growth without special culture conditions. In Bacillus anthracis spores can be formed under certain conditions. Highly heat-resistant spores in the external environment is very difficult death, can survive in the soil environment endures for many years, once the soil is contaminated, extremely difficult to remove. Place in the event of anthrax, the epidemic will continue to occur repeatedly, the general means of prevention is difficult to stop. Therefore, as an ancient disease anthrax, has never disappeared. According to the survey, most recently in Liaoning Province and other places of anthrax outbreaks, patients had contact with dead cattle slaughtered or experience, are common causes of morbidity naturally infected with anthrax. Statistics show that almost all of anthrax occurred or popular around the world, including Asia, most of Africa and parts of the Americas, there are endemic area. In developed countries, anthrax is rare in developing countries, is still a serious threat of anthrax infections. In China, anthrax, although the incidence is not high, but it is also not uncommon. In recent years, in hundreds of cases occur every year, from the last century to the present, a declining trend in the incidence of anthrax. Experts stressed that once yourself or someone suffering from anthrax around, do not panic, you should immediately report to the local health center or disease prevention and control institutions, seek immediate medical attention. Note that the patient's excretions, secretions disinfected or incinerated. Try to avoid contagion main source of anthrax infection source is dead herbivores, if found in cattle sheep and other animals died suddenly, his mouth, nose, anus, etc. coagulation of the blood is not flowing, do not peel the food should be immediately reported to the local agricultural livestock sector. Dead animals on treatment to comply with the requirements from the source to prevent the occurrence of anthrax. Purchased through the formal channels of beef and mutton are to undergo quarantine, cooked cooking cooking can be safe to eat. Experts stressed that the most important thing is to prevent infection is not contagious sources. For anthrax infection does not occur between people say, experts pointed out that under natural circumstances, this infection is rare indeed, but it does not mean there is no danger. According to reports, after people suffering from anthrax, Bacillus anthracis can be excreted through certain means. In cutaneous anthrax ulcer edge exudate, often detachable bacteria; lot of intestinal anthrax bacteria excreted. The reason that less prone to human transmission, because people do not have easy access to anthrax bacteria discharge, less the amount of cutaneous anthrax bacteria discharged, the ulcer has been particularly evident, people will pay attention to avoid contact, while the incidence of other types of anthrax very low. Experts stressed that the provisions of anthrax must be isolated country, aimed at preventing the spread of environmental pollution expand. Once this bacterial diseases occur, penicillin is the drug of choice for treatment. In most cases, no Bacillus anthracis resistant to penicillin. There are a variety of broad-spectrum antibiotics effective for the treatment of anthrax, can be selected according to specific circumstances. Links are three types of anthrax anthrax are mainly three kinds of clinical types: cutaneous anthrax, pulmonary anthrax, and intestinal anthrax, anthrax, some patients may develop into severe sepsis and meningitis, of which the most common cutaneous anthrax, accounting for over 95% of all cases.\nSkin anthrax is more common in exposed parts changed the face, neck, shoulders and hands skin, mainly for the local skin edema, rash, blisters, ulcers and eschar, pain is not obvious, a little itching, no abscess formation. Timely treatment mortality is less than 1%. Pulmonary anthrax since the beginning of the flu-like symptoms, manifested as fever, fatigue, malaise, myalgia, cough, usually lasting about 48 hours; then suddenly develop into an acute illness, respiratory distress, gas Ji Chuan-ming, cyanosis, cough, hemoptysis and so on. Coma and death can occur quickly, the mortality rate of up to 90%. Intestinal anthrax may manifest as acute enteritis or acute abdomen type. Acute enteritis type can occur at the onset of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea. Type of acute abdomen in patients with severe systemic symptoms, persistent vomiting and diarrhea, bloody stools row, bloating, abdominal pain, often complicated by sepsis and septic shock. If not treated, can often lead to death.\n\n(This article Source: People's Daily - People's Daily Overseas Edition)\n \n"},{"id":"53302ec1f99fe75cf538f375","translation":"\n\n\n                To link to this article his diary:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout two hundred Illichivske kids are sitting at home.

Public health officials in the United States believe that the young man may have contracted the _Neisseria meningitidis_ (meningococcus) in the lab in San Francisco where he was working on a vaccine against the disease. The information is from the Guardian newspaper.\n\n\n\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, its acronym in English) of the country are trying to confirm their suspicions: that Din is an atypical case of scientists who die infected by agents of their laboratories.\n\n\n\nTom Skinner, spokesman for the CDC in Atlanta, must test a biopsy sample of the bacteria Din and another laboratory in which he worked, creating a \"fingerprint\" for each. \"If the fingerprints are equal, it is highly likely that he acquired the infection working in the lab,\" says Skinner. \"A researcher get sick and die because of a body that was working is very rare,\" he adds.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, dozens of people, including relatives, close friends, co-workers and doctors who have treated Din are receiving antibiotics as a precaution.\n\n\n\nHarry Lampiris, chief of the infectious diseases department at the San Francisco Veterans Affairs Medical Center, where Din worked, believes it is likely that the researcher has died from his work with the bacterium that causes meningitis and bloodstream infections. \"It is our responsibility to assume that there was an association with the laboratory until proven otherwise,\" he said Lampiris.\n\n\n\nSince the 1960s, vaccines for some types of meningococcal disease are available. However, scientists at the San Francisco lab spent over 20 years trying unsuccessfully to develop a vaccine against serogroup B, which killed Din.\n\n\n\nDin died of multiple organ failure caused by meningococcal infection and septic shock, according to Eileen Shields, spokeswoman for the Department of Public Health San Francisco. The researcher died less than 1 day after getting sick.\n\n\n\nThe disease can be rapid, with symptoms such as high fever, headache, stiff neck, vomiting, rash, confusion and fatigue.\n\n\n\nThe Division of Occupational Safety of California is investigating the circumstances surrounding the death of Din, along with its federal agency, CDC, the Department of Public Health and the San Francisco VA.\n\n\n\n-\n\nReported by:\n\nPromed-Port\n\npromed-port@promedmail.org\n\n\n\n[The episode in question (although it is associated with a bacterium against which there are no effective vaccines, meningococcus B) alert to a question in much neglected: the importance of vaccination for professionals working in pathology laboratories, particularly those related with microbiology and virology.\n\n\n\nIn addition to the routine vaccines (including hepatitis B, influenza, chickenpox, whooping cough, measles, mumps, rubella ...), vaccination against meningococcus (ideally the tetravalent conjugate vaccine A/C/Y/W135) is only one of those that could (in some cases must) be used in many individuals belonging to this occupational group.

This was reported by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) in updating weekly (published August 31) of the maps on the spread of disease from West Nile virus (WNV) in Europe. ECDC, based on data provided by the U.S. CDC, also speaks of a large outbreak in the United States and, to August 28, 1590 cases of illness from West Nile virus in humans. Of these, 56% were classified as neuro-invasive disease. This is the most extensive outbreak since 1999, the year in which the disease was identified for the first time in the United States.\n\nIn Italy, as reported by ECDC in Communicable disease threats report 26 August - 1 September (pdf 321 kb) on August 3, has been reported a case of asymptomatic infection with West Nile virus in a man resident in the Province of Venice. The case was identified through systematic screening of blood donors, activated already for several years, within the Venetian provinces where they had already been cases of WNV in the past. In this regard, see also the article published on August 2 Eurosurveillance \"New endemic West Nile virus lineage 1a in Northern Italy, July 2012.\" For full details on the epidemiological situation in Italy in recent years refer to the deepening EpiCentro published on September 8, 2011 \"The monitoring of cases of West Nile disease in Italy, 2008-2011.\"\n\nIn our country there is an integrated epidemiological surveillance system for the identification and confirmation of the presence of human cases of neuro-invasive disease from West Nile virus. The human surveillance allows, together with the animal and entomological surveillance is to detect virus circulation in a given geographical area and to get an estimate of its impact through the systematic identification of human clinical cases emerging. The surveillance takes place throughout the year for imported cases while autochthonous cases were registered in areas with proven circulation of WNV in animals and surrounding areas, is active from June 15 to November 30 of each year. Read about it in the circular of the Ministry of Health \"Surveillance of human cases of vector-borne diseases with special reference to chikungunya, dengue and West Nile Disease - Update 2012\" (pdf 1.2 Mb).\n\nThere is no vaccine to protect humans from this disease. That's why prevention through protection from mosquito bites and accurate information, crucial. One must remember that the transmission in either animals or humans occurs through the bite of infected mosquitoes mainly belonging to the genus Culex. The virus remains in the environment through the continuous passage between mosquitoes and birds are the reservoir of infection. important to remember that the virus is not transmitted from person to person. The transmission can occur instead for transfusion, removal of organs and tissues, laboratory errors, pregnancy and, in rare cases, breast-feeding.\n\nIn this regard, on the site of the national blood center provides the information about measures to prevent the transmission of infection from WNV transfusion which provide for the temporary suspension (28 days) of blood donors and blood components who also stayed for one night in places to viral circulation demonstrated both in Italy and abroad. On the website of the National Transplant Centre (CNT) are published on the signs of WNV transmission through organ transplantation, tissues and cells. The paper suggests a range of interventions for the prevention of transmission of the virus through transplantation and for the early detection of donor grafts positive for WNV. Download the document \"Guidelines for the transmission of West Nile Virus (WNV) by organ transplantation, tissues and cells in the season summer-autumn 2012\" (pdf 64 kb) and read the first floor on the site of the NTC.\n\nIn general there are two approaches to prevent the spread of cases, one individual and one of collettivit. The first, explicitly tied to the individual, (especially those over the age of 50 and who has chronic medical conditions) provides for the adoption of behaviors \"protective\" designed to avoid contact with the vector mosquitoes. For example, eliminate standing water around the home (eg saucers and collections of water otherwise), stay indoors or protect themselves from mosquito bites at dawn and dusk (the time of greatest activity of the vector), wear dresses with sleeves and long legs, use insect repellents both outdoors and indoors, and so on.\n\nThe second preventive approach to collettivit and involves the health authorities at national, regional and local bodies who must activate the epidemiological surveillance to monitor and detect cases of illness in the community. In addition, as specified in the circular of the Ministry of Health \"Surveillance of human cases of vector-borne diseases with special reference to chikungunya, dengue and West Nile Disease - Update 2012\" (pdf 1.2 Mb), where there is a suspicion of WNV circulation , surveillance in urban areas should include mosquito traps in strategic positions and periodic testing of those captured. An increase in the rate of infection in mosquitoes may in fact be predictive of an increased rate of infection in humans. If the surveillance should detect an increase in unusual cases of WNV infection in mosquitoes caught must be immediately activated control measures on carriers depending on the presence of animal or human cases in the affected area, in order to prevent possible outbreaks.

May 30, 2012, the CCP State Council issued \"Long-term animal epidemic prevention plan (2012-2020),\" said the Chinese animal epidemic prevention and control challenges, some of zoonotic diseases is rising, even in some areas outbreak. Brucellosis reached a new peak from the north spread to the south of brucellosis, also known as the Mediterranean remittent fever, Malta fever. In 1887, Sir Scottish pathologist and microbiologist David • Bruce (David Bruce) to determine the relationship between the disease and a bacterium, which was later named the bacteria Brucella. It is a zoonotic infectious disease. With SARS and AIDS equivalents are classified as Class B infectious diseases. Brucellosis in the past, mainly in the northern areas of concentrated livestock, but the epidemic spread to the south, the country except Hainan province have reported outbreaks. Brucellosis has never appeared before in Guangzhou, the epidemic has increased year by year since 2005. September 2011 to combat animal diseases known Northeast Agricultural University 28 students and teachers who are exposed suddenly suffering from brucellosis, brucellosis resurgence which opened tip of the iceberg. Prevention and treatment of infectious disease experts said Beijing Ditan Hospital, as zoonotic disease brucellosis to livestock infect humans based. The main approach is to contact spread, other means including diet, contact with sick animals fur. Acute patients will be high fever, joint pain, sweating, which is generally more typical symptoms. 2011 autumn and winter season, who lives in the village of Chengde City, South barracks big jintanzhen Fengning County, Hebei Province, Zhang Cong 46 years and into the chronic phase of brucellosis infection. More than a month later, Zhang Cong's wife Zhang Guoqin has similar symptoms. \"As long as the body work more will feel boring, like a soft bones, as fierce whole body sweating.\" Zhangguo Qin said. Zhang Cong home of more than 60 breeding sheep, he is responsible for the management of these sheep, including delivery, Zhang Guoqin will help take care of. According to the doctor analysis, precisely because of the couple's only close contact with sheep infected with brucellosis. According to CDC statistics, Fengning County, Chengde City, Hebei Province, where the high incidence of brucellosis, an incidence of Fine incidence of Chengde County accounted for Liu Cheng. Fengning County CDC Division is responsible for the disease to be introduced, said Zhang, the annual incidence of the county in 2011 to 77 cases, while the number of cases since the beginning of this year alone has already reached 64 cases, \"according to the current trend in the incidence of true rise. \"\n                \n\n\n\n\n\nPlease pay attention to the advertising business Epoch to Epoch friend, thank you for your support!\n\n\n                This article URL: http://epochtimes.com/gb/12/6/5/n3605250.htm Chinese SARS outbreak and the same column B infectious diseases - there is no effective vaccine\n                    ET: 2012-06-05 03:57:23 AM [calendar]\n\n\n"},{"id":"532cad2df99fe75cf538614a","translation":"MENINGITIS - MOROCCO\n\n*****************\n\n\n\nCommunication ProMED-mail\n\nhttp://www.promedmail.org\n\nProMED-mail is a program of the\n\nInternational Society for Infectious Diseases\n\nhttp://www.isid.org\n\n\n\nDate: Wed, June 6th, 2012\n\nSource: Aufait Morocco [edited]\n\nhttp://www.aufaitmaroc.com/maroc/societe/2012/6/6/un-enfant-decede-dune-meningite-aigue_178028.html\n\n\n\n\n\nA child dies of acute meningitis\n\n-------------------------------------\n\nThe Ministry of Health has reported the death on Wednesday [6 June 2012]\n\na child of 9 years after acute meningitis, meningococcal\n\nType B.\n\nThe family and the school share the same class, have\n\nreceived chemoprophylaxis, said the department in a\n\nstatement.\n\nThe Ministry reports that each year, just over 900 cases\n\nsporadic meningitis all combined forms, are reported to\n\nMorocco, with a fatality rate of about 10 percent.\n\nAccording to the latest data from epidemiological surveillance, ensures\n\nthe Ministry, the current situation does not raise concern (355\n\nduring the first 5 months of 2012).\n\nThe strategy of prevention and control of this disease relies\n\nfocus on monitoring and warning, immunization\n\naround cases and closed communities and chemo\n\nprophylaxis.\n\nPreventive measures are taken with the family and\n\nenvironment of registered cases.\n\nThe ministry said that since the introduction of vaccination\n\nagainst the Haemophilus type B, as well as against pneumococcal\n\nthe number of registered cases of meningitis fell sharply for those\n\ntypes of bacteria.\n\n\n\n-\n\nCommunicated by:\n\nProMED-\n\n<promed-fra@promedmail.org>\n\n\n\n[The Morocco is not part of the meningitis belt; this case\n\ncould be an isolated case that should not alarm people.\n\nBut health authorities should not overlook the\n\nsituation and to take appropriate measures to prevent\n\npossible cases of meningitis.

Mod RNA] for those with weak immune systems, but that can be treated with antibiotics.\n\n\n\nHealth authorities, who have launched an investigation to determine the cause of the outbreak [apparently nothing unusual. Again, they, cooling towers - Mod RNA], stressed that the latest count includes cases reported in the last 10 to 15 days.\n\n\n\n-\n\nReported by: ProMED-PORT\n\n\n\n[In relation to this outbreak, the likely source of infection, again, are cooling towers, already a classic.

Legionellosis The term includes all diseases caused by bacteria of the genus _Legionella_.\n\n\n\nThe Legionnaires' disease was first described in 1976 from an outbreak (221 cases, 34 deaths) occurred during the meeting of the American Legion in Pennsylvania. The identification of the etiologic agent was given 6 months after the outbreak. During this period, there was speculation about the possibility until it is a government experiment to test a new biological weapon. With agent identification and development of diagnostic methods, it was found in retrospect that several outbreaks of pneumonia in the 1950s and 1960s were caused by bacteria of the genus _Legionella_.\n\n\n\nEpidemiological and microbiological investigations showed later that _Legionella_ occurs naturally in the aquatic environment, multiplying especially in basins with higher temperatures as cooling towers, water heaters, drinking water reservoirs.\n\n\n\nFrom these sources of infection, nosocomial and community outbreaks is often documented in some countries. Among the community outbreaks can be highlighted Murcia / Spain (2001: 700 cases, 6 deaths), Barrow-in-Furness/Inglaterra (2002: 130 cases, 6 deaths), Bovenkarspel / Holland (1999: 188 cases, 21 deaths).\n\n\n\nAlthough the most common pulmonary condition, in some situations Legionnaires' disease can lead to systemic complications (central nervous system, liver, spleen, bone marrow, kidneys, muscles, joints, heart valves).\n\n\n\nHere are some references about other outbreaks of legionellosis associated with cooling towers:\n\n- MR Ferre et al.

Leishmaniasis is a parasitic disease caused by protozoa of the genus Leishmania. Actually it's own animal, but can also affect humans. Rodents and small mammals, especially dogs, are the animals most often have this parasite. However, sometimes the parasite is transmitted to humans through the bite of a particular mosquito.

July 2012, the incidence of 34 cases of anthrax.\nAnthrax in 90% of cutaneous anthrax\nMortality does not exceed 3%\nProvincial Communicable Disease Control director, chief physician LING Junfeng introduced Anthrax is caused by Bacillus anthracis, Bacillus anthracis mainly survive on pasture, so it is easy to be cattle, sheep and other herbivores intake, there is an in vitro Bacillus anthracis layer of spores, which it is to form a protective, so its ability to survive in the natural environment is very strong, can survive for a long time in the animal carcasses as well as its polluted environment.\nAnthrax is divided into several types: through the skin infection called invasive cutaneous anthrax; through inhalation, anthrax bacilli into the lungs called pulmonary anthrax; And by eating infected food, water, into the intestine caused by Bacillus anthracis Anthrax is called intestinal anthrax. Among them, skin contact with diseased poultry meat and edible disease, anthrax is the main reason. The cutaneous anthrax accounted for about 90%, is the most common anthrax.\n\"Normal skin anthrax fatality rate does not exceed 3%, pulmonary anthrax, and intestinal anthrax will have more serious, especially the most severe intestinal anthrax fatality infected population can exceed 50%.\"\nThe anthrax occurred both in Jiangsu and Liaoning, that is cutaneous anthrax through skin contact occurs.\nNo anthrax patients in Zhejiang Province after 1949\nEating out and eating infected beef is generally not\n\"Most of those infected, and livestock are in contact with Bacillus anthracis history.\" LING Junfeng said that if there is break the skin when exposed to animals with anthrax, it will be invaded.\nBut generally not contagious from person to person, usually dinner without fear of being infected, unless anthrax intentionally conspire to wound someone else to go.\nCan not eat beef on the issue, the Director of the livestock industry in Hangzhou Bureau of Agriculture Tian Xiaoming said that at present, Hangzhou people to eat beef and domestic beef to Origin Shandong, Inner Mongolia, more beef imports mainly from Spain, the Netherlands, Brazil and other countries . Security has a strict quality supervision model for edible agricultural products in Hangzhou, the possible cause of zoonotic diseases in all countries have strict requirements checks. Former exotic animals and products into Hangzhou have to accept the inspection and quarantine inspection station, after passing the examination before entering the slaughterhouse slaughtering, after entering the circulation.\n\"This rigorous testing regime to ensure the safety of food, as long as the beef farms or in supermarkets and other formal channels of purchase, are basically safe.\"\nLING Junfeng said infected cattle, anthrax occurred mainly in their fur and fat, very few will go to the meat. Therefore little likelihood of being ingested. But engaging in livestock slaughter and fur processing work the crowd, to frequent contact with the fur of animals exposed to anthrax can easily become infected.\nBacillus anthracis spores layer of protection, the ability to survive in the natural environment is very strong, but can be killed by high temperatures. When eating beef, boiled beef as long as more than 15 minutes, Bacillus anthracis can be killed, you can be safe to eat. If you eat raw beef carrying Bacillus anthracis, which can only be infected.\nHowever, in Zhejiang Province since 1949, there have been one case of anthrax patients. Anthrax patients in China are mainly concentrated in animal husbandry developed regions. Therefore, Zhejiang, the disease eat infected beef, the possibility is very small, so do not worry about eating beef infected with anthrax, if it do not worry, it does not try to eat cooked beef.\nMetro Supermarket Meat Head Jiang Jingli and gold long Gudang farmers market, general manager, said yesterday that the current sales of beef basically not affected, everyone's consumption is quite rational.\nAnthrax incubation period of about a week\nEarly detection of high cure rate\nBacillus anthracis infection, because it has an incubation period of about a week, so the start is not easy to find, just some red rash.\nAfter that, as the disease progresses, the Bacillus anthracis protective antigen, edema factor and pathogenic factor composed of complex, can cause tissue edema and hemorrhage. Bacillus anthracis invade the skin, can multiply rapidly, undermining the soft tissue surrounding skin, blisters scab occurs after formation as black as coal depression. This process, in general, nothing special other symptoms, and only a handful of people with fever and so on.\nContinue to develop the disease, toxins invade deeper and more destructive. Once the toxins destroy the blood vessels into the bloodstream, can cause sepsis, the condition will be much worse.\nThird People's Hospital of Hangzhou, MD, director of dermatology main 任沈宏 said earlier anthrax development, if timely medical treatment, the use of ciprofloxacin, doxycycline and other antibiotics treatment, the effect is quite good, but the treatment time is relatively long, it takes about two months. People infected with anthrax, may leave some of the less serious sequelae, such as a relatively large area of ​​skin wound infection, may leave a scar after treatment.\n\"Varying degrees in different parts of the aftermath, it will be better on the arm, eyes and other parts will be more serious infection.\" LING Junfeng said that if infected people do not seek immediate medical attention turned from sepsis after anthrax treatment up more trouble , and while the mortality will increase a lot.\nAfter treatment cured the infection, the body will produce immunity against anthrax, and can last for a long period of time.\nIs there a vaccine to prevent anthrax play? LING Junfeng said, there are specialized prevention of anthrax vaccine, but because of the chance of infection in the general population is small, and a shorter duration of antibodies, it is generally recommended only engaged in livestock slaughter, fur processing industry and other high-risk occupations injectable anthrax vaccine, prevention infected at work.\n"},{"id":"53303254f99fe75cf538fab9","translation":"\n\nAt least 119 cases of fungal meningitis with 11 deaths were reported in the United States after injection of contaminated steroids, according to the latest available balance sheet, published Tuesday, October 9, which worsens.\nThe previous record of Federal Government Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 105 cases including eight deaths.
